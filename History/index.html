                <h3>History</h3>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <p>Turkey has a long history of predecessors Islamic Empires in middle east such 
                    as the Byzantian empire, the Seljuk empire and lastly the Ottoman Empire. 
                    After World war I the Ottoman empire collapsed, and large parts of Turkey 
                    today were occupied by the Allied forces and some other countries. Then 
                    Mustafa Kemal Pasha, a high respected and high ranking general, started the 
                    Turkish nationalist resistance against the Ottoman government and the Allied 
                    powers. This led to the Turkish War of Independence. Mustafa Kemal Pasha won the war and 
                    established the Republic of Turkey. Mustafa Kemal Pasha became the founding father of the Republic 
                    of Turkey and after the surname revolution, one of Ataturk’s revolutions, he took the surname Ataturk, 
                    which means “Father of the Turks”. Ataturk revolutionized Turkey and established modern standards 
                    in Turkey. Turkey is still the only Islamic country in which state and religion are separated. The country 
                    of the Republic of Turkey basically serves as a bridge between Asia and Europe that is why it is 
                    influenced by both cultures.</p>
